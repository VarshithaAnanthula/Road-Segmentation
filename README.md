# Road-Segmentation

 Road segmentation model tailored for remote sensing imagery, utilises advanced com
puter vision techniques. The model focuses on extracting detailed road networks from
 high-resolution satellite or aerial images, effectively addressing challenges across var
ious geographic and environmental conditions. Built on a sequential neural network
 architecture, the methodology integrates image preprocessing, feature extraction, and
 classification algorithms to differentiate between road and non-road pixels. Augmen
tation techniques like image rotation and shifting enhance dataset variability for robust
 adaptability. The model is rigorously evaluated using quantitative metrics, showcasing
 its accuracy and efficiency across different landscapes. This highlights the modelâ€™s po
tential applications in autonomous vehicle navigation and environmental monitoring,
 emphasizing its significance in automated road segmentation methods and geospatial
 analyses. The model achieved an accuracy of 99.01% in delineating road networks in
 remote sensing imagery.
